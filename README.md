#### Writing tests

Use [Pytest](https://pytest.org/) and
[Unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html).

Add your unit tests to the [tests directory](tests). Filenames must be prefixed
with `test_`, as well as procedure names. There should be a one-to-one relation
between test files and modules. For instance, `test_foo.py` and `test_bar.py`
should contain all the tests for the `dogpt.foo` and `dogpt.bar` modules,
respectively.

For more information, refer to [Pytest docs](https://docs.pytest.org/) and
[Unittest docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html).
